# VALLEY-SEASON CLASSIFICATION WINDOWS (single source of truth)

# A detected absence-valley is labeled winter/summer by which of these windows
# it overlaps most. These windows are intentionally WIDER than the meteorological
# season ranges above so that valleys straddling the migration shoulders still
# resolve to the adjacent season.
#
# IMPORTANT: Both the classification stage (classify_migration_patterns.py) and
# the timing stage (calculate_arrival_departure.py / timing_helpers.py) label
# valley seasons through the shared helpers in valley_detection.py, which read
# these windows. Do NOT redefine winter/summer week ranges anywhere else — a
# second definition is exactly what caused spring/fall labels to disagree
# between the two stages.
