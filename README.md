# Flightcall

*Know what to find, and where to look.*

A bird phenology web application that displays migration timing, detection probabilities, and birding hotspots for species in your region. Built with eBird data. The root landing page serves as a county directory; each county's app lives in its own subdirectory.

**Live Example:** Washtenaw County, Michigan (327 species, 315 hotspots)

## Features

- **This Week View**: See which species are arriving, at peak, or departing this week
- **Browse All Species**: Search and filter by migration category
- **Species Detail Pages**: View annual frequency charts, migration timing, and top hotspots
- **Hotspot Directory**: Browse birding locations with species counts and detailed guides
- **Hotspot Detail Pages**: View parking, hours, habitats, tips, and notable species per location
- **Interactive Week Navigation**: Browse any week of the year
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Quick Start

### View the Web Application

1. Copy your processed species data to the web app:
```bash
cp regions/[region_name]/[region_name]_species_data.json washtenaw/data/species_data.json
```

2. Serve with a local server from the repo root (serves both landing page and county app):
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Landing page:  http://localhost:8000
# County app:    http://localhost:8000/washtenaw/
```

### Process Data for Your Region

1. Download eBird barchart data for your region from [eBird](https://ebird.org/barchart)
2. Create a region directory and place the `.txt` file in it:
```bash
mkdir -p regions/[region_name]
mv ebird_*.txt regions/[region_name]/
```

3. Run the pipeline:
```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py [region_name]
```

4. Copy the output to the web app:
```bash
cp regions/[region_name]/[region_name]_species_data.json washtenaw/data/species_data.json
```

- Notable species (rare or specialty birds for the location)

### Design System

The app uses a "Field Journal" aesthetic - warm, naturalist-inspired design with a cozy, professional feel. Defined in [washtenaw/css/styles.css](washtenaw/css/styles.css).

**Typography:**
- **Headings**: Bitter (warm slab-serif)
- **Body**: DM Sans (friendly, modern sans-serif)

**Color Palette:**
- **Header/footer**: `#2D3E36` (forest green) with terracotta/ochre accent stripe
- **Main background**: `#FAF6F1` (warm cream)
- **Cards**: White with soft shadows and colored left borders
- **Primary accent**: `#C17F59` (terracotta)
- **Secondary accent**: `#C9A55C` (ochre)
- **Category badges**: Resident (forest), Single-season (ochre), Two-passage (moss), Vagrant (terracotta)
- **Status indicators**: Arriving (green), At peak (ochre), Departing (rust)

### Adding a New County

Everything is driven by the root `counties.json` manifest — the landing page cards, the Michigan map, and the deploy workflow all read it. County app files are identical across counties (pages derive the county slug from the URL and the display name from the manifest), so there is nothing to hand-edit.

**1. Scaffold (before data arrives):**
```bash
python3 scripts/new_county.py genesee US-MI-049
```
This writes `regions/genesee/config.json`, adds a "coming soon" entry to `counties.json`, and creates `genesee/` from the shared app. Commit and push — the coming-soon card and map shading deploy automatically.

**2. When the eBird data arrives:**
```bash
# Barchart .txt        -> regions/genesee/
# EBD download folder  -> regions/genesee/   (release-named ebd_* folder is auto-renamed)
python3 scripts/run_all.py genesee
```

**3. Go live:** flip `"status": "soon"` to `"live"` in `counties.json`, commit, and push all pipeline outputs.

### Updating the Shared County App

`washtenaw/` is the canonical copy of the app. Edit HTML/JS/CSS there, then propagate:
```bash
python3 scripts/sync_counties.py           # copy to all county dirs (data/ untouched)
python3 scripts/sync_counties.py --check   # report drift without changing anything
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

The pipeline processes raw eBird barchart data into structured JSON for the web application.

### Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up eBird API key (for hotspot fetching)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: EBIRD_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Get a free eBird API key at: https://ebird.org/api/keygen

### Species Data Pipeline

```bash
# Run complete pipeline for a region
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py [region_name]

# Or run steps individually:
python3 scripts/parse_ebird_data.py [region_name]            # Step 1: Parse eBird barchart
python3 scripts/calculate_annual_presence.py [region_name]   # Step 2: Annual presence from EBD (optional)
python3 scripts/classify_migration_patterns.py [region_name] # Step 3: Classify species
python3 scripts/calculate_arrival_departure.py [region_name] # Step 4: Calculate timing
python3 scripts/merge_to_json.py [region_name]               # Step 5: Generate final JSON
```

### Hotspot Data Pipeline

```bash
# Fetch hotspot data from eBird API
python3 scripts/fetch_hotspots.py [region_name]

# Create content file for a new hotspot
python3 scripts/new_hotspot_content.py L320822

# Build enriched hotspot JSON (merges content with base data)
python3 scripts/build_enriched_hotspots.py [region_name]
```

Or run every pipeline (species, hotspots, hotspot guide) in one shot:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_all.py [region_name]
```

### Pipeline Steps

**1. parse_ebird_data.py**
- Parses eBird barchart `.txt` file
- Filters out unidentified species (sp.) and hybrids
- Outputs JSON and CSV formats

**2. calculate_annual_presence.py** *(optional — skips gracefully if EBD not present)*
- Reads the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) for the region
- Counts distinct years in which each species was recorded (last 10 complete years)
- Outputs `[region]_annual_presence.json` — used by the classify step

**3. classify_migration_patterns.py**
- Uses valley detection to classify species
- Categories: Resident, Single-season, Two-passage Migrant, Vagrant
- Valley = 4+ consecutive weeks below 15% of peak frequency
- Species recorded in ≤ 3 of the last 10 years are reclassified as vagrant (requires step 2)

**4. calculate_arrival_departure.py**
- Calculates arrival, peak, and departure timing
- Converts week numbers to date ranges
- Threshold: 10% of peak frequency or 0.1% absolute

**5. merge_to_json.py**
- Merges all data into final JSON
- Generates unique 6-letter species codes
- Structures timing by category

### Output Files

**Final outputs:**
- `regions/[region]/[region]_species_data.json` - Species data for web app
- `regions/[region]/hotspots/[region]_hotspots.json` - Hotspot data

**Intermediate files** (in `regions/[region]/intermediate/`):
- `[region]_ebird_data.json` - Parsed frequency data
- `[region]_annual_presence.json` - Years recorded per species (last 10 complete years)
- `[region]_migration_pattern_classifications.csv` - Species classifications
- `[region]_migration_timing.csv` - Arrival/departure timing

## Hotspot Content Authoring

Hotspot content files are Markdown with YAML frontmatter. See `regions/washtenaw/hotspots/content/_template.md` for the full template.

```markdown

hours: "Dawn to dusk"
fee: "Free"
features:
  - Restrooms at Nature Center
  - Paved and unpaved trails
habitats:
  - Mature oak-hickory forest
  - River edge

## Requirements

- **Web Application**: Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Data Processing**: Python 3.6+
- **Python packages**: `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `python-frontmatter`

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Automated)

The repository is configured for automatic deployment:

1. Push changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions deploys to `gh-pages` branch:
   - `index.html`, `about.html`, `CNAME`, `counties.json` → site root (`/`)
   - every county listed in `counties.json` → `/<county>/` subdirectory
3. Site updates at `https://flight-call.org` (the commit step no-ops when nothing changed)

New counties deploy automatically once they appear in `counties.json` — the workflow never needs editing.

**Setup** (one-time):
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch `gh-pages`, folder `/ (root)`

### Other Hosting

**Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages:**
- Publish directory: repo root
- No build command needed
- Both `index.html` and `washtenaw/` will be served correctly

**Traditional hosting:**
- Upload `index.html` and the `washtenaw/` directory to web root
- Ensure all `washtenaw/data/*.json` files are included
